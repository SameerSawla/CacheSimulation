This is my solution to implement Least-Recently-Used Cache using Java.

The question is generally asked in interviews with the firms that require lot of database operations and to avoid those, they tend to maintain a cache which could be effectively then used in their code.

The solution uses the LinkedHashMap as the data structure for impementing this.
